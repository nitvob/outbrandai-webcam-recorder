# Outbrand.ai Webcam Recorder Application

## Overview

Welcome to the Outbrand.ai Webcam Recorder project! This application enables users to record videos directly from their webcam using a seamless web interface. Built on the FEAN stack (Firebase, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), it harnesses Firebase for real-time storage and database management, Angular for a dynamic front-end, and NG Prime components for a polished user experience.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to streamline user engagement by allowing them to capture, review, confirm, and upload videos directly to Firebase Storage. Video metadata is securely saved in the Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring robust content management. This application contributes to the user-generated content revolution by providing a modern, efficient platform for video creation and storage.

## Project Features

1. **Video Recording**: Users can capture videos from their webcam with intuitive start and stop controls.
2. **Video Review and Confirmation**: After recording, users can preview the video and either confirm or redo the recording.
3. **Video Upload**: Confirmed videos are uploaded to Firebase Storage with a progress indicator for a transparent upload process.
4. **Secure Metadata Storage**: Video metadata, including the storage path, is saved under the user's record in the Firebase Realtime Database.
5. **Cross-Device Compatibility**: The application is thoroughly tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent performance.

## Repository Structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

- `frontend`: Contains the Angular application with NG Prime components. See [FRONTEND_README.md](https://github.com/nitvob/outbrandai-webcam-recorder/tree/main/frontend#readme) for detailed setup instructions.
- `backend`: Houses the Node.js and Express.js server code integrated with Firebase. See [BACKEND_README.md](https://github.com/nitvob/outbrandai-webcam-recorder/tree/main/backend#readme) for backend-specific details.

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally, you need to configure both the frontend and backend components. Each section includes its own README.md file with detailed setup and usage instructions:

- For frontend setup, refer to [FRONTEND_README.md](https://github.com/nitvob/outbrandai-webcam-recorder/tree/main/frontend#readme).
- For backend configuration, see [BACKEND_README.md](https://github.com/nitvob/outbrandai-webcam-recorder/tree/main/backend#readme).

Follow the instructions to get the application running on your local development environment.

## Knowledge and Skills Gained

Through this project, I deepened my expertise in frontend development by building dynamic, user-friendly interfaces with Angular and NG Prime components. I enhanced my backend development skills by managing server-side logic using Node.js and Express.js, while seamlessly integrating the Firebase ecosystem for real-time database management and secure storage. Additionally, I refined my ability to test applications across multiple devices and browsers, ensuring consistent performance. This project also strengthened my capacity to collaborate on full-stack development, delivering a cohesive and scalable solution that addresses user needs effectively.
